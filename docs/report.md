## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.5 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 63,284 (approx.) | 14.30% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 30,099 | 91.10% | 1.8 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 7,366 | 60.20% | 8 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 2,745 | 47.30% | 21.8 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,256 | 18.80% | 47.6 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **47.30%** (range 14.30% to 91.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.30 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.02M SOL ($1.24B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **124K SOL (0.96%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.4 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.04B | 1.2/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.22M | $116.04M | 1.1K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 414.53K | $39.52M | 190.7/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $35.56M | 39.4/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 38.98K | $3.72M | 242.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 28.03K | $2.67M | 492.5/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 23.33K | $2.22M | 597/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 20.72K | $1.98M | 345.2/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 7 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 606 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.220 | 565 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.210 | 565 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.187 | 572 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.149 | 572 | 0.0003 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.140 | 531 | 0.0012 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.137 | 531 | 0.0015 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.135 | 531 | 0.0018 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 373.35K USD | DeFiLlama: 785.84K USD | -71.17% | *indicative*: 0.48x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 95.33 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 95.33 USD | 0.00% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.28M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.28M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
