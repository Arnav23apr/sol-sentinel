## Program activity and chain health

Chain clock drift: **+15.1 s** against wall clock (slots run slightly longer than the nominal 400 ms, so chain time falls behind real time).

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 66,297 (approx.) | 38.60% | 0.8 s |
| Pump.fun | 24,623 | 86.30% | 2.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 1,663 | 36.40% | 36 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 961 | 43.80% | 62.3 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 578 | 14.40% | 103.5 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **38.60%** (range 14.40% to 86.30%). This is a consistent trend signal across these five programs, not a chain-wide rate.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.25 SOL**.

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 3 of 3 agree this run. Rows marked *indicative* are reported for corroboration but never raise an alert, because their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth acting on.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 307.71K USD | DeFiLlama: 516.12K USD | -50.60% | agree (0.60x), *indicative* |
| SOL price | coingecko: 74.03 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 73.97 USD | +0.08% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.05M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.05M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
