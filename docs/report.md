## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.6 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 58,787 (approx.) | 27.10% | 0.7 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 34,805 | 82.10% | 1.5 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 17,505 | 65.30% | 2.9 s |
| Pump.fun | 16,086 | 79.10% | 3.7 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 6,500 | 34.70% | 9.1 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **65.30%** (range 27.10% to 82.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.31 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.67M SOL ($1.22B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **411K SOL (3.14%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.2 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.41M | $908.88M | 1.1/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 2.35M | $227.36M | 1.3K/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.26K | $36.44M | 40/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 356.43K | $34.43M | 157.9/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 66.07K | $6.38M | 187.5/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 43.22K | $4.17M | 218.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 35.85K | $3.46M | 394.3/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 26.24K | $2.53M | 769.2/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 9 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 689 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.216 | 648 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.201 | 648 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.189 | 655 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.152 | 655 | 0.0001 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.126 | 614 | 0.0018 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.124 | 614 | 0.0021 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.122 | 614 | 0.0025 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.118 | 654 | 0.0025 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.118 | 614 | 0.0033 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 441.13K USD | DeFiLlama: 889.16K USD | -67.36% | *indicative*: 0.50x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 96.60 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 96.39 USD | +0.22% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
