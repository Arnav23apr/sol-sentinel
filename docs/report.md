## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.2 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 58,144 (approx.) | 22.20% | 0.8 s |
| Pump.fun | 19,885 | 88.50% | 2.9 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,589 | 41.80% | 37.7 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 1,143 | 29.80% | 52.1 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 797 | 62.10% | 71.2 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **41.80%** (range 22.20% to 88.50%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.22M SOL ($928.14M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **196K SOL (1.57%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.1 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.75M | $740.32M | 13.5/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.59M | $121.03M | 923.1/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 396.46K | $30.10M | 119.8/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.72M | 52.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 41.75K | $3.17M | 392.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 41.59K | $3.16M | 455.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 37.78K | $2.87M | 136.8/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 36.49K | $2.77M | 251.7/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 392 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.258 | 351 | 0.0000 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.190 | 340 | 0.0004 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.189 | 340 | 0.0005 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.177 | 351 | 0.0009 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.170 | 381 | 0.0009 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 932.67K USD | DeFiLlama: 468.52K USD | +66.25% | *indicative*: 1.99x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.93 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 75.89 USD | +0.05% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.90M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.90M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
