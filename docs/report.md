## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.3 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pump.fun | 64,496 (approx.) | 92.60% | 0.7 s |
| SPL Token | 62,779 (approx.) | 41.80% | 0.4 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 21,678 | 83.90% | 1.8 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 6,898 | 71.40% | 7.7 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 2,094 | 37.10% | 28.6 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **71.40%** (range 37.10% to 92.60%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **516.94 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.79M SOL ($1.25B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **279K SOL (2.14%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.1 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.06B | 1.2/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 916.66K | $89.44M | 1.1K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 422.78K | $41.25M | 196.4/h | 1 |
| Bybit | 377.27K | $36.81M | 169.4/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 63.55K | $6.20M | 268.1/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 39.34K | $3.84M | 283.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 33.15K | $3.23M | 289.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 32.76K | $3.20M | 388.8/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 9 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 669 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.228 | 628 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.189 | 628 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.184 | 635 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.146 | 635 | 0.0002 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.128 | 634 | 0.0012 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.128 | 594 | 0.0018 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.122 | 594 | 0.0030 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.119 | 594 | 0.0036 |
| Total TPS moves with Activity index | +0.118 | 634 | 0.0028 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 539.82K USD | DeFiLlama: 928.73K USD | -52.97% | *indicative*: 0.58x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 97.57 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 97.77 USD | -0.20% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
