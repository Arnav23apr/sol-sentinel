## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+15.5 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 51,310 | 36.50% | 1.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 3,948 | 32.00% | 14.9 s |
| Pump.fun | 2,889 | 40.50% | 20.7 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 2,667 | 59.10% | 22.5 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,545 | 51.20% | 38.1 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **40.50%** (range 32.00% to 59.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **522.68 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.09M SOL ($1.23B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **138K SOL (1.07%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.02B | 1.1/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.22M | $114.19M | 911.4/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 438.93K | $41.14M | 137.8/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $34.96M | 34/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 45.33K | $4.25M | 230.3/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 40.22K | $3.77M | 240.2/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 37.34K | $3.50M | 165.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 23.29K | $2.18M | 461.5/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 8 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 597 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.219 | 556 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.211 | 556 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.186 | 563 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.147 | 563 | 0.0005 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.143 | 522 | 0.0011 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.139 | 522 | 0.0014 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.138 | 522 | 0.0016 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.133 | 522 | 0.0023 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 493.82K USD | DeFiLlama: 785.84K USD | -45.64% | *indicative*: 0.63x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 93.73 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 93.78 USD | -0.05% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.28M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.28M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
