## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.3 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 54,519 (approx.) | 23.80% | 0.8 s |
| Pump.fun | 9,228 | 77.10% | 5.8 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 1,559 | 41.00% | 38.1 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 649 | 27.10% | 92.3 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 586 | 45.20% | 102.2 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **41.00%** (range 23.80% to 77.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.17M SOL ($936.16M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **19K SOL (0.15%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.1 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.75M | $750.17M | 2.8/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.53M | $117.96M | 855.1/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 392.86K | $30.23M | 86.9/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $25.05M | 31.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 50.64K | $3.90M | 351.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 45.92K | $3.53M | 483.2/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 39.04K | $3.00M | 207.6/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 30.17K | $2.32M | 166.1/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 434 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.227 | 393 | 0.0000 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.174 | 365 | 0.0008 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.166 | 365 | 0.0014 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.162 | 406 | 0.0011 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.159 | 393 | 0.0016 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 548.13K USD | DeFiLlama: 649.17K USD | -16.88% | *indicative*: 0.84x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 76.94 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 76.91 USD | +0.04% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.89M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.89M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
