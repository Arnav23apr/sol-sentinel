## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.8 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 81,634 (approx.) | 34.10% | 0.4 s |
| Pump.fun | 58,434 (approx.) | 95.10% | 0.8 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 2,026 | 25.20% | 29 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 1,811 | 41.10% | 33.1 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,341 | 28.60% | 43.9 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **34.10%** (range 25.20% to 95.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.19M SOL ($923.25M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **205K SOL (1.66%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.6 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.75M | $813.88M | 15.6/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 562.69K | $42.60M | 927.8/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 397.12K | $30.07M | 85.2/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.65M | 38.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 42.23K | $3.20M | 528.6/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 41.89K | $3.17M | 480/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 38.19K | $2.89M | 195.1/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 36.89K | $2.79M | 203.4/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 390 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.258 | 349 | 0.0000 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.193 | 338 | 0.0003 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.187 | 338 | 0.0006 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.177 | 349 | 0.0009 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.171 | 379 | 0.0008 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 998.24K USD | DeFiLlama: 468.52K USD | +72.23% | *indicative*: 2.13x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.71 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 75.68 USD | +0.04% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.90M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.90M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
