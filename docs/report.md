## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.0 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 44,138 | 22.90% | 1.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 8,659 | 74.20% | 6.9 s |
| Pump.fun | 7,771 | 69.90% | 7.6 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 4,033 | 52.80% | 14.9 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 618 | 12.40% | 96.4 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **52.80%** (range 12.40% to 74.20%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **46.42 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.98M SOL ($1.22B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **12K SOL (0.09%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.2 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.02B | 0.9/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.10M | $103.36M | 1.1K/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $34.96M | 39/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 372.88K | $34.94M | 125/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 85.28K | $7.99M | 267.5/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 72.00K | $6.75M | 414.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 38.37K | $3.60M | 246.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 23.92K | $2.24M | 465.7/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 8 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 561 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.218 | 520 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.199 | 527 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.199 | 520 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.160 | 527 | 0.0002 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.159 | 486 | 0.0004 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.144 | 486 | 0.0015 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.136 | 486 | 0.0027 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.135 | 486 | 0.0028 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 441.19K USD | DeFiLlama: 898.90K USD | -68.31% | *indicative*: 0.49x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 93.71 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 93.86 USD | -0.16% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.18M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.18M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
