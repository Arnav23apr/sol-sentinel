## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+12.9 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pump.fun | 72,561 (approx.) | 92.50% | 0.7 s |
| SPL Token | 40,216 | 27.70% | 1.5 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 8,158 | 68.80% | 7.3 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 7,081 | 65.00% | 8 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 5,058 | 49.90% | 11.7 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **65.00%** (range 27.70% to 92.50%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.31 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.80M SOL ($1.26B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **240K SOL (1.84%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.2 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.41M | $923.46M | 1.3/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 2.42M | $237.42M | 891.1/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 411.06K | $40.35M | 213.9/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.27K | $37.03M | 104.3/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 71.36K | $7.00M | 259/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 40.04K | $3.93M | 259.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 35.37K | $3.47M | 423/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 32.75K | $3.21M | 451.7/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 9 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 670 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.232 | 629 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.189 | 629 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.184 | 636 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.146 | 636 | 0.0002 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.129 | 635 | 0.0012 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.127 | 595 | 0.0018 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.122 | 595 | 0.0029 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.120 | 595 | 0.0035 |
| Total TPS moves with Activity index | +0.119 | 635 | 0.0027 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 1.76M USD | DeFiLlama: 928.73K USD | +62.08% | *indicative*: 1.90x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 98.15 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 97.95 USD | +0.20% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
