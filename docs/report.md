## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.5 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 44,712 | 28.60% | 1.1 s |
| Pump.fun | 8,846 | 69.30% | 6.6 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 6,172 | 66.90% | 8 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 2,506 | 61.40% | 23.4 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 788 | 29.10% | 75.7 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **61.40%** (range 28.60% to 69.30%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **667.55 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.07M SOL ($1.31B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **91K SOL (0.69%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.09B | 1.2/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 1.19M | $119.22M | 1.8K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 435.44K | $43.55M | 278.4/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.27K | $37.73M | 103.8/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 51.49K | $5.15M | 257.1/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 39.84K | $3.98M | 195.3/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 34.78K | $3.48M | 266.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 30.38K | $3.04M | 558.1/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 6 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 660 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.226 | 619 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.200 | 619 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.183 | 626 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.145 | 626 | 0.0003 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.142 | 585 | 0.0006 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.126 | 625 | 0.0015 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 499.68K USD | DeFiLlama: 928.73K USD | -60.07% | *indicative*: 0.54x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 100.01 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 100 USD | +0.01% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
