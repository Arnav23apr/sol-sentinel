## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+17.3 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 78,879 (approx.) | 36.90% | 0.4 s |
| Pump.fun | 37,989 | 93.60% | 1.2 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 6,619 | 61.70% | 8.3 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 3,009 | 70.30% | 19.9 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 778 | 12.00% | 76.6 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **61.70%** (range 12.00% to 93.60%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **311.44 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.56M SOL ($1.07B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **410K SOL (3.37%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $930.84M | 1.8/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 755.44K | $64.46M | 1.3K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 373.53K | $31.87M | 124.9/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $27.78M | 63.8/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 61.72K | $5.27M | 170.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 55.64K | $4.75M | 446.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 41.99K | $3.58M | 481.9/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 39.30K | $3.35M | 220/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 4 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 468 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.237 | 427 | 0.0000 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.188 | 393 | 0.0002 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.174 | 434 | 0.0003 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.163 | 427 | 0.0008 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 823.17K USD | DeFiLlama: 649.17K USD | +23.64% | *indicative*: 1.27x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 85.33 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 85.36 USD | -0.04% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.01M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.01M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
