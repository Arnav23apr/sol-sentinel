## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+12.2 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 52,145 | 17.60% | 1.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 3,722 | 48.00% | 15.6 s |
| Pump.fun | 2,881 | 58.60% | 20.7 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 2,834 | 39.50% | 20.7 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,891 | 46.70% | 31.6 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **46.70%** (range 17.60% to 58.60%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **716.08 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.10M SOL ($1.23B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **180K SOL (1.40%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.02B | 1.1/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.23M | $115.41M | 888.9/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 441.85K | $41.38M | 115.3/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $34.93M | 35.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 46.82K | $4.38M | 220.2/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 40.95K | $3.83M | 146/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 36.86K | $3.45M | 156.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 23.21K | $2.17M | 236.5/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 8 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 595 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.222 | 554 | 0.0000 |
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.217 | 554 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.188 | 561 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.150 | 561 | 0.0004 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.141 | 520 | 0.0013 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.140 | 520 | 0.0014 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.140 | 520 | 0.0014 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.131 | 520 | 0.0027 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 343.56K USD | DeFiLlama: 785.84K USD | -78.32% | *indicative*: 0.44x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 93.65 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 93.73 USD | -0.09% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.28M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.28M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
