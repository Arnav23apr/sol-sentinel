## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.0 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pump.fun | 80,268 (approx.) | 95.40% | 0.7 s |
| SPL Token | 54,277 | 36.10% | 1.1 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 4,880 | 26.90% | 12.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 2,417 | 26.50% | 23.8 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,862 | 64.00% | 30.7 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **36.10%** (range 26.50% to 95.40%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **37.86 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.91M SOL ($1.22B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **193K SOL (1.48%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.03B | 1/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.10M | $103.74M | 1.3K/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $35.22M | 38.1/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 364.34K | $34.40M | 120.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 55.01K | $5.19M | 578.8/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 44.50K | $4.20M | 157/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 42.02K | $3.97M | 253.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 23.63K | $2.23M | 476.8/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 571 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.210 | 530 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.206 | 537 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.198 | 530 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.168 | 537 | 0.0001 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.161 | 496 | 0.0003 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 625.67K USD | DeFiLlama: 898.90K USD | -35.84% | *indicative*: 0.70x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 94.42 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 94.57 USD | -0.16% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.18M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.18M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
