## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.4 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 66,248 (approx.) | 31.50% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 26,428 | 84.60% | 2.2 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 9,972 | 67.50% | 5.9 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 3,865 | 58.10% | 15.4 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 678 | 15.90% | 88.2 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **58.10%** (range 15.90% to 84.60%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.30 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.15M SOL ($1.25B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **47K SOL (0.36%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 24.0 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.04B | 1.3/h | 8 |
| Binance (2) | 1.24M | $117.83M | 1.1K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 425.69K | $40.48M | 207.5/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $35.47M | 42.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 81.89K | $7.79M | 290.3/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 64.14K | $6.10M | 261.1/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 41.16K | $3.91M | 339/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 17.31K | $1.65M | 479.4/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 636 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.211 | 595 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.185 | 602 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.183 | 595 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.147 | 602 | 0.0003 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.144 | 561 | 0.0006 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 419.00K USD | DeFiLlama: 696.89K USD | -49.81% | *indicative*: 0.60x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 95.09 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 95.32 USD | -0.24% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.28M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.28M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
