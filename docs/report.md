## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.4 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 80,181 (approx.) | 32.40% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 38,610 | 88.40% | 1.5 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 11,525 | 67.90% | 5.1 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 3,996 | 42.90% | 15 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 3,996 | 61.50% | 15 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **61.50%** (range 32.40% to 88.40%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.31 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.37M SOL ($1.19B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **396K SOL (3.10%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.1 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.41M | $903.51M | 1.1/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 2.06M | $197.58M | 989/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.26K | $36.23M | 46.9/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 358.16K | $34.39M | 214.3/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 71.21K | $6.84M | 229.2/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 40.40K | $3.88M | 354.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 29.90K | $2.87M | 376.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 26.99K | $2.59M | 770.9/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 4 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 702 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.217 | 661 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.199 | 661 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.189 | 668 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.152 | 668 | 0.0001 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 465.06K USD | DeFiLlama: 889.16K USD | -62.63% | *indicative*: 0.52x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 96.03 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 96.06 USD | -0.03% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.37M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
