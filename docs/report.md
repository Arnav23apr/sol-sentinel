## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+15.0 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 73,866 (approx.) | 43.80% | 0.4 s |
| Pump.fun | 41,685 (approx.) | 96.30% | 0.8 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 2,851 | 44.10% | 20.8 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,581 | 18.60% | 37.1 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,122 | 57.20% | 52.9 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **44.10%** (range 18.60% to 96.30%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.21M SOL ($926.45M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **221K SOL (1.78%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.8 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.75M | $815.39M | 51.6/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 569.25K | $43.18M | 1.0K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 398.06K | $30.19M | 160.1/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.69M | 32.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 55.01K | $4.17M | 400.9/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 43.37K | $3.29M | 318.3/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 40.22K | $3.05M | 664.2/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 32.87K | $2.49M | 208/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 381 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.254 | 340 | 0.0000 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.192 | 332 | 0.0004 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.190 | 332 | 0.0005 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.178 | 340 | 0.0010 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.173 | 373 | 0.0008 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 474.34K USD | DeFiLlama: 468.52K USD | +1.23% | *indicative*: 1.01x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.85 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 75.80 USD | +0.07% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.90M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.90M SOL | 0.00% | agree |
