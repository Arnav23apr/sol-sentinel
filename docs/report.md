## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.1 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 64,116 (approx.) | 43.10% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 7,819 | 53.00% | 7 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 3,372 | 40.70% | 17.6 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,676 | 67.90% | 35.1 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,665 | 45.30% | 33.7 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **45.30%** (range 40.70% to 67.90%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.31 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.70M SOL ($1.23B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **136K SOL (1.06%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.6 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.41M | $913.20M | 1.2/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 2.36M | $229.17M | 923.1/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 379.33K | $36.82M | 187.5/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.27K | $36.62M | 497.2/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 63.55K | $6.17M | 153.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 41.37K | $4.02M | 759.5/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 36.34K | $3.53M | 468.8/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 35.01K | $3.40M | 197.4/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 9 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 683 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.216 | 642 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.188 | 642 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.185 | 649 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.148 | 649 | 0.0001 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.129 | 608 | 0.0015 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.126 | 608 | 0.0019 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.123 | 608 | 0.0024 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.119 | 648 | 0.0025 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.118 | 608 | 0.0036 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 587.87K USD | DeFiLlama: 928.73K USD | -44.95% | *indicative*: 0.63x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 97.06 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 97.20 USD | -0.14% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
