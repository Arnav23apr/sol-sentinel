## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.0 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 50,814 | 37.10% | 1.1 s |
| Pump.fun | 8,226 | 66.90% | 7.2 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 3,231 | 47.80% | 15.9 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,039 | 52.50% | 56.9 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 851 | 23.90% | 70.3 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **47.80%** (range 23.90% to 66.90%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **516.94 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.91M SOL ($1.29B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **340K SOL (2.57%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.09B | 1.2/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 1.03M | $102.80M | 997.2/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 432.64K | $43.09M | 315.8/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.27K | $37.57M | 105.3/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 53.67K | $5.35M | 229/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 39.07K | $3.89M | 252.5/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 30.87K | $3.07M | 356.8/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 30.59K | $3.05M | 236.4/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 7 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 663 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.226 | 622 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.199 | 622 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.187 | 629 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.149 | 629 | 0.0002 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.136 | 588 | 0.0010 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.130 | 628 | 0.0011 |
| Total TPS moves with Activity index | +0.120 | 628 | 0.0026 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 882.15K USD | DeFiLlama: 928.73K USD | -5.14% | *indicative*: 0.95x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 99.59 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 99.50 USD | +0.09% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
