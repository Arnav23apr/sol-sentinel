## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.5 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 68,708 (approx.) | 37.90% | 0.8 s |
| Pump.fun | 5,684 | 48.90% | 10.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 2,395 | 41.80% | 24.8 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,410 | 73.90% | 36.1 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 721 | 32.10% | 83.1 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **41.80%** (range 32.10% to 73.90%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **38.10 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.24M SOL ($929.69M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **198K SOL (1.59%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.6 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.75M | $816.46M | 1.3/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 590.89K | $44.88M | 1.4K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 399.39K | $30.33M | 132/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.72M | 49.5/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 56.74K | $4.31M | 421.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 40.97K | $3.11M | 468.8/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 40.12K | $3.05M | 300/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 37.16K | $2.82M | 268.1/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 377 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.256 | 336 | 0.0000 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.194 | 329 | 0.0004 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.190 | 329 | 0.0006 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.178 | 336 | 0.0010 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.162 | 370 | 0.0017 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 457.40K USD | DeFiLlama: 468.52K USD | -2.40% | *indicative*: 0.98x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.95 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 76.01 USD | -0.08% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.90M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.90M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
