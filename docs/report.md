## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+23.4 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 65,535 (approx.) | 43.70% | 0.8 s |
| Pump.fun | 26,387 | 86.40% | 2.1 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 2,665 | 62.20% | 22.4 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 2,060 | 28.70% | 26.2 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,635 | 16.30% | 35.7 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **43.70%** (range 16.30% to 86.40%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.16M SOL ($938.34M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **63K SOL (0.52%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.7 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.75M | $752.12M | 4.1/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.53M | $117.98M | 1.3K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 393.70K | $30.37M | 127.7/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $25.11M | 31.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 50.60K | $3.90M | 389.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 46.86K | $3.61M | 433.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 36.30K | $2.80M | 324.3/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 31.67K | $2.44M | 208.9/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 3 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 422 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.240 | 381 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.192 | 381 | 0.0002 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.172 | 358 | 0.0011 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 490.84K USD | DeFiLlama: 732.76K USD | -39.54% | *indicative*: 0.67x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 77.14 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 77.03 USD | +0.14% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.89M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.89M SOL | 0.00% | agree |
