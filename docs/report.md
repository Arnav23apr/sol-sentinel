## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+12.7 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 59,983 (approx.) | 28.80% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 11,866 | 73.10% | 4 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 7,779 | 63.30% | 7.6 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 3,826 | 42.10% | 13.8 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,278 | 23.20% | 46.9 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **42.10%** (range 23.20% to 73.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.30 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.03M SOL ($1.24B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **121K SOL (0.93%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.5 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.04B | 1.2/h | 5 |
| Binance (2) | 1.23M | $116.87M | 751.6/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 391.11K | $37.27M | 90.9/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.03K | $35.55M | 28.9/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 62.86K | $5.99M | 142.6/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 36.19K | $3.45M | 184.6/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 17.08K | $1.63M | 412.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 15.64K | $1.49M | 421.5/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 7 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 620 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.212 | 579 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.209 | 579 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.180 | 586 | 0.0000 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.145 | 545 | 0.0007 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.142 | 586 | 0.0006 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.131 | 545 | 0.0022 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.128 | 545 | 0.0027 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 451.37K USD | DeFiLlama: 785.84K USD | -54.07% | *indicative*: 0.57x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 95.30 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 95.23 USD | +0.07% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.28M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.28M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
