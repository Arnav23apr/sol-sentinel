## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.4 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 69,855 (approx.) | 46.50% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 22,817 | 74.40% | 2.6 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 14,892 | 85.10% | 4 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 5,078 | 67.50% | 11.7 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,872 | 49.20% | 31.8 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **67.50%** (range 46.50% to 85.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.31 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.42M SOL ($1.19B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **370K SOL (2.89%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.4 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.41M | $903.23M | 1.1/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 2.10M | $201.22M | 1.6K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 388.67K | $37.31M | 235.6/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.26K | $36.22M | 74.3/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 66.52K | $6.39M | 256.6/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 39.33K | $3.78M | 257.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 31.94K | $3.07M | 297/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 16.14K | $1.55M | 789.5/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 6 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 700 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.214 | 659 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.200 | 659 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.190 | 666 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.152 | 666 | 0.0001 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.121 | 625 | 0.0026 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.118 | 665 | 0.0023 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 431.02K USD | DeFiLlama: 889.16K USD | -69.41% | *indicative*: 0.48x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 96 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 96.21 USD | -0.22% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
