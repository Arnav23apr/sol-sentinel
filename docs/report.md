## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+15.7 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pump.fun | 82,190 (approx.) | 94.80% | 0.4 s |
| SPL Token | 71,971 (approx.) | 41.30% | 0.4 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 5,799 | 63.60% | 10.3 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 3,107 | 74.40% | 18.9 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,264 | 38.70% | 47.3 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **63.60%** (range 38.70% to 94.80%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **299.27 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.61M SOL ($1.03B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **444K SOL (3.65%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.6 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.75M | $796.38M | 2/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.96M | $159.82M | 2.5K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 380.44K | $31.07M | 197.6/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $26.59M | 232/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 65.35K | $5.34M | 311.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 63.53K | $5.19M | 465.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 48.14K | $3.93M | 411.4/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 25.13K | $2.05M | 352.9/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 4 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 455 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.236 | 414 | 0.0000 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.190 | 380 | 0.0002 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.165 | 421 | 0.0007 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.163 | 414 | 0.0008 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 595.16K USD | DeFiLlama: 649.17K USD | -8.68% | *indicative*: 0.92x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 81.68 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 81.78 USD | -0.12% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.01M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.01M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
