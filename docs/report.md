## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.6 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 51,067 (approx.) | 32.30% | 0.8 s |
| Pump.fun | 33,802 | 91.30% | 1.2 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 4,206 | 49.90% | 14 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,856 | 43.10% | 32.2 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,528 | 12.10% | 39.2 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **43.10%** (range 12.10% to 91.30%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.16M SOL ($935.79M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **29K SOL (0.24%) moved off exchanges** over the last 24.0 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.75M | $750.36M | 4.1/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.53M | $117.66M | 997.2/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 393.44K | $30.28M | 109.7/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $25.05M | 35.7/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 49.99K | $3.85M | 333.6/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 47.21K | $3.63M | 334.6/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 34.54K | $2.66M | 175.8/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 29.95K | $2.31M | 258.4/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 425 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.241 | 384 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.190 | 384 | 0.0002 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.170 | 360 | 0.0012 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.163 | 360 | 0.0019 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.161 | 401 | 0.0012 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 517.03K USD | DeFiLlama: 732.76K USD | -34.52% | *indicative*: 0.71x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 76.96 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 77.01 USD | -0.06% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.89M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.89M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
