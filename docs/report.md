## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+15.1 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 32,827 | 35.30% | 1.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 23,894 | 89.00% | 2.5 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 1,585 | 33.20% | 37.6 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,447 | 70.40% | 41 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,136 | 43.20% | 51.4 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **43.20%** (range 33.20% to 89.00%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.42M SOL ($935.72M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **792 SOL (0.01%) moved off exchanges** over the last 12.9 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.75M | $809.58M | 1.3/h | 1 |
| Binance (2) | 784.17K | $59.06M | 884.5/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 401.57K | $30.24M | 85.2/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.52M | 36.4/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 47.19K | $3.55M | 172.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 39.01K | $2.94M | 241.1/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 38.71K | $2.92M | 239.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 38.68K | $2.91M | 188.7/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 4 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 336 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.246 | 295 | 0.0000 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.232 | 295 | 0.0001 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.196 | 295 | 0.0007 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.185 | 336 | 0.0007 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 403.29K USD | DeFiLlama: 593.84K USD | -38.22% | *indicative*: 0.68x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.31 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 75.26 USD | +0.07% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.78M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.78M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
