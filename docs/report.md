## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.0 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 55,261 (approx.) | 36.20% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 13,091 | 83.20% | 4.4 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 8,636 | 70.60% | 5.5 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 1,424 | 51.80% | 42.1 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 779 | 22.50% | 76.5 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **51.80%** (range 22.50% to 83.20%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **807.06 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.95M SOL ($1.21B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **4K SOL (0.03%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 23.7 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.02B | 1.2/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.17M | $108.88M | 909.1/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $34.72M | 41.6/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 343.10K | $31.94M | 126.6/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 53.39K | $4.97M | 337.7/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 41.85K | $3.90M | 140.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 33.97K | $3.16M | 159.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 24.06K | $2.24M | 322.6/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 8 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 586 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.223 | 545 | 0.0000 |
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.213 | 545 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.192 | 552 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.153 | 552 | 0.0003 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.141 | 511 | 0.0014 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.133 | 511 | 0.0026 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.132 | 511 | 0.0028 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.132 | 511 | 0.0028 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 873.18K USD | DeFiLlama: 785.84K USD | +10.53% | *indicative*: 1.11x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 93.08 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 93 USD | +0.09% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.28M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.28M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
