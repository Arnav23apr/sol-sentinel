## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+12.7 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 30,309 | 27.70% | 1.5 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 12,056 | 70.90% | 4.1 s |
| Pump.fun | 7,833 | 60.70% | 7.4 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 4,818 | 65.30% | 11.4 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 3,564 | 23.10% | 16.6 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **60.70%** (range 23.10% to 70.90%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **37.86 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.92M SOL ($1.20B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **162K SOL (1.24%) moved off exchanges** over the last 24.0 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.02B | 1.1/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.09M | $101.13M | 1.5K/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $34.74M | 34.3/h | 1 |
| Gate.io | 356.88K | $33.24M | 140.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 82.05K | $7.64M | 144.6/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 46.19K | $4.30M | 480.6/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 45.24K | $4.21M | 226.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 24.30K | $2.26M | 502.8/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 6 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 576 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.209 | 535 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.200 | 542 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.198 | 535 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.161 | 542 | 0.0002 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.160 | 501 | 0.0003 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.135 | 501 | 0.0024 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 1.11M USD | DeFiLlama: 898.90K USD | +21.26% | *indicative*: 1.24x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 93.14 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 93.13 USD | +0.01% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.18M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.18M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
