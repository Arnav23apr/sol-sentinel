## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.8 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 36,926 | 18.50% | 1.2 s |
| Pump.fun | 15,241 | 80.10% | 3.7 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 2,770 | 58.10% | 20.3 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 996 | 54.10% | 59.6 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 529 | 25.70% | 111.7 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **54.10%** (range 18.50% to 80.10%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.21M SOL ($922.83M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **213K SOL (1.72%) moved off exchanges** over the last 24.0 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.75M | $736.81M | 10.8/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.58M | $119.38M | 697.7/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 395.25K | $29.87M | 94.6/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.60M | 33.8/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 45.28K | $3.42M | 445/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 44.85K | $3.39M | 444.4/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 37.02K | $2.80M | 115.6/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 33.93K | $2.56M | 185.6/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 394 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.255 | 353 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.202 | 353 | 0.0001 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.190 | 340 | 0.0004 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.189 | 340 | 0.0005 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.170 | 381 | 0.0009 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 534.98K USD | DeFiLlama: 468.52K USD | +13.25% | *indicative*: 1.14x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.57 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 75.48 USD | +0.12% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.90M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.90M SOL | 0.00% | agree |
