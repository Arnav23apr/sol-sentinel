## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+15.7 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 34,618 | 16.90% | 1.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 17,273 | 81.30% | 3.3 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 2,969 | 14.00% | 19.9 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 2,689 | 41.20% | 21.9 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 2,023 | 35.00% | 24.8 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **35.00%** (range 14.00% to 81.30%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.28 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.44M SOL ($936.50M) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **18K SOL (0.14%) moved onto exchanges** over the last 18.8 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.75M | $809.05M | 1.2/h | 1 |
| Binance (2) | 802.21K | $60.37M | 814.5/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 400.24K | $30.12M | 56.1/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 325.52K | $24.50M | 20.4/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 42.67K | $3.21M | 372.3/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 42.63K | $3.21M | 210.5/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 40.34K | $3.04M | 450.6/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 39.94K | $3.01M | 132.2/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 4 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 348 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.240 | 307 | 0.0000 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.217 | 307 | 0.0001 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.193 | 307 | 0.0007 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.173 | 348 | 0.0012 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 461.27K USD | DeFiLlama: 593.84K USD | -25.13% | *indicative*: 0.78x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 75.26 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 75.24 USD | +0.03% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 582.78M SOL | CoinGecko: 582.78M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
