## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+12.7 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 76,906 (approx.) | 41.20% | 0.7 s |
| Pump.fun | 27,188 | 80.30% | 1.8 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 6,037 | 63.70% | 9.9 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 2,004 | 67.90% | 29.6 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 1,248 | 19.70% | 47.9 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **63.70%** (range 19.70% to 80.30%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **35.31 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.73M SOL ($1.24B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **201K SOL (1.56%) moved off exchanges** over the last 24.0 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 9.41M | $919.13M | 1.2/h | 9 |
| Binance (2) | 2.38M | $232.23M | 1.4K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 389.40K | $38.04M | 187.6/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 377.27K | $36.86M | 408.6/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 69.10K | $6.75M | 204.9/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 38.30K | $3.74M | 233.8/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 33.43K | $3.27M | 509.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 31.95K | $3.12M | 875.9/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 8 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 677 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.221 | 636 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.189 | 636 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.184 | 643 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.146 | 643 | 0.0002 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.128 | 602 | 0.0016 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.126 | 602 | 0.0019 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.124 | 602 | 0.0024 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Activity index | +0.120 | 642 | 0.0024 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 605.45K USD | DeFiLlama: 928.73K USD | -42.14% | *indicative*: 0.65x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 97.69 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 97.76 USD | -0.07% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.38M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.38M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
