## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+14.5 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pump.fun | 53,083 | 83.00% | 1.1 s |
| SPL Token | 49,878 | 26.20% | 1.1 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 9,022 | 40.00% | 6.3 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 3,865 | 48.90% | 15.5 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 3,188 | 47.20% | 18.4 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **47.20%** (range 26.20% to 83.00%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **37.86 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

12.90M SOL ($1.21B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **202K SOL (1.54%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.9 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.03B | 0.9/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.10M | $103.13M | 1.2K/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $35.09M | 40.7/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 364.36K | $34.28M | 132.2/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 55.09K | $5.18M | 500.7/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 41.97K | $3.95M | 160.6/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 41.81K | $3.93M | 189.6/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 23.67K | $2.23M | 522.5/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 5 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 570 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.208 | 529 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.205 | 536 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.199 | 529 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.166 | 536 | 0.0001 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.159 | 495 | 0.0004 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (0 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 5.01M USD | DeFiLlama: 898.90K USD | +139.16% | *indicative*: 5.57x, outside the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 94.08 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 94.18 USD | -0.11% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.18M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.18M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
