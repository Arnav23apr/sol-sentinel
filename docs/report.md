## Program activity and chain health

Chain tip lag: **+13.3 s**, the age of the newest confirmed block's own timestamp against wall clock. It sits at a steady offset rather than accumulating; a rise means confirmations are falling behind.

Throughput and failure rate for major programs, from the last 1,000 signatures on each, timed by slot span. The failure rate is a direct read on user experience and is not published by volume-only dashboards.

| Program | Transactions/min | Failed | Sample window |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPL Token | 37,541 | 20.00% | 1.5 s |
| Jupiter v6 | 6,239 | 60.60% | 9.5 s |
| Pump.fun | 4,536 | 61.70% | 12.7 s |
| Orca Whirlpools | 3,284 | 66.70% | 18.2 s |
| Raydium AMM v4 | 537 | 18.20% | 110.9 s |

Median failure rate across the sampled programs: **60.60%** (range 18.20% to 66.70%). A median over five programs, not a chain-wide rate, and it varies widely between them.

Unwithdrawn inflation rewards sitting in the top 8 vote accounts: **46.42 SOL**.

## Exchange and large-holder balances

13.00M SOL ($1.22B) across 8 publicly-attributed accounts. Net **10K SOL (0.07%) moved off exchanges** over the last 23.7 h.

| Account | Balance (SOL) | Value | Activity | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance | 10.91M | $1.02B | 0.9/h | 0 |
| Binance (2) | 1.12M | $105.05M | 1.4K/h | 0 |
| Gate.io | 375.63K | $35.18M | 122.4/h | 0 |
| Bybit | 373.02K | $34.94M | 42.1/h | 0 |
| Kraken | 83.81K | $7.85M | 301.3/h | 0 |
| Coinbase (2) | 72.22K | $6.76M | 256/h | 0 |
| Bitget | 37.65K | $3.53M | 257.9/h | 0 |
| Coinbase | 25.52K | $2.39M | 264.1/h | 0 |

*Balances are re-verified on the chain every run and an account is dropped if it no longer holds a meaningful amount, so a stale label cannot become a false claim. Attribution is best-effort from public sources: Sentinel verifies what an account holds, never who controls it.*

## What moves together

Relationships between metrics, rather than each metric on its own. 8 of 117 tested pairs survive, over 559 observations.

*Method: Spearman rank correlation of period-over-period changes, with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control at q=0.05 across all pairs tested. Changes are correlated rather than levels, because two series that both drift upward correlate near +1 whatever the real relationship. Rank correlation is used so a single outlier cannot manufacture a result.*

| Relationship | rho | n | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeFi TVL moves with xStocks AUM | +0.215 | 518 | 0.0000 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with Slot time | +0.200 | 525 | 0.0000 |
| DEX volume moves with App fees | +0.200 | 518 | 0.0000 |
| Total TPS moves with Slot time | +0.161 | 525 | 0.0002 |
| Slot time moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.157 | 484 | 0.0005 |
| AMM write-lock congestion moves with Program failure rate | +0.143 | 484 | 0.0016 |
| Total TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.136 | 484 | 0.0027 |
| Non-vote TPS moves with AMM write-lock congestion | +0.136 | 484 | 0.0028 |

## Cross-source validation

Quantities that two independent sources can both see, compared against each other. 2 of 2 precise checks agree this run. A further 1 indicative check is reported for corroboration only (1 within band): their own measurement noise is wider than any threshold worth alerting on, so they never raise a finding and are not counted as agreement.

| Quantity | Source A | Source B | Gap | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chain fees (24h) | sampled blocks (RPC): 558.62K USD | DeFiLlama: 898.90K USD | -46.69% | *indicative*: 0.62x, within the order-of-magnitude band |
| SOL price | coingecko: 93.66 USD | Jupiter (on-chain DEX): 93.80 USD | -0.15% | agree |
| Circulating supply | getSupply (RPC): 583.18M SOL | CoinGecko: 583.18M SOL | -0.00% | agree |
